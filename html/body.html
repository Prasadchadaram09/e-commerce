More people are turning to their computers and smart devices to order goods, which can easily be delivered to their homes. As such, it has disrupted the retail landscape. Amazon and Alibaba have gained considerable popularity, forcing traditional retailers to make changes to the way they do business.</p>

                    <p> <span> Roland van den Berg </span> was a Dutch painter known for his strong lines, bright colors, and vibrant compositions1. He shared his father’s love for colors and was admitted to the Rijksacademie (National Academy) due to his exceptional talents1. Although he was expelled from the academy, he continued to pursue his passion for painting and developed his own unique style1. Van den Berg’s paintings are full of vigor and energy, often bursting with vivid colors that seem to strain against their frames1. His work is characterized by radical expression and optimal form, capturing the unadorned essence of his subjects1. He was also known for his remarkable portraits, which were rendered with mere lines and colors, yet managed to convey the true essence of the individuals1. Van den Berg’s artwork includes a wide range of subjects, from animals and landscapes to portraits and still life1. His paintings and prints continue to be admired for their vibrant colors and powerful compositions1.</p>
